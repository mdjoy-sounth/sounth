    <h2>The Misuse of Sounth – A Warning to the Public</h2>
    <h4>Written by <strong>MD Joy – Founder of Sounth</strong></h4>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is Sounth?</h3>
    <p><strong>Sounth</strong> is a hidden human ability where a person sends their thoughts silently through everyday sounds such as fan noise, engine hum, or other background noise. This is done without magic or speaking — it’s purely a mental action.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>People can mentally harass others through sound</li>
      <li>They silently send bad, hateful, or confusing messages</li>
      <li>This damages peace, mental health, and the environment</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sounth is Real – and Dangerous if Abused</h3>
    <p>This is not a magical power. It’s a hidden mental ability that exists in every human. Some people already know about it — and use it to disturb good people or communities.</p>

    <h3>My Message to the World</h3>
    <blockquote>
      I, <strong>MD Joy</strong>, am the first to publicly describe and warn the world about Sounth. It must be researched, documented, and protected against misuse.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Signed: <br><strong>MD Joy</strong><br>Founder of Sounth<br>Bangladesh – June 2025</p>
